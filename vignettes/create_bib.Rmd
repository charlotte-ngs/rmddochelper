## Disclaimer
This vignette descibes how a bib-file created for a certain R-markdown document that contains citation references. 


## Backgroud
When writing scientific publications or technical documentations, certain background information is described by citing other sources. The references to these sources are listed at the end of the document in a separate section. In principle, it is possible to compile the list of reference manually based on the cited sources in the text. Such a manual procedure is tedious and error-prone. 


## Automated Procedure
Manual compilation of references should be avoided at all costs. Hence, we have to come up with an automated procedure. Possible approaches to generating a reference list automatically are described in this section. 


### A first attempt
An initial fast solution to the problem is to let the reference manager export all publication entries into one bib-file. This single bib-file is then used in the bibliography field of the yaml-header in the R-markdown document. While this approach works well for documents that are written by a single author, it does not work well when multiple co-authors write on the same document. The problem with this approach for multiple co-authors is that every co-author would need to have access to the same reference manager database and the locally exported bib-file would have to be stored in a directory having the same name and the same path. In addition to that when reference manager databases grow, these bib-files can get large and it might be slow to generate only a few references out of a huge database of publications. 


### A refined approach
