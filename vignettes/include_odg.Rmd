## Disclaimer
This vignette describes the search for and the design for an easy to use functionality to include ODG-Graphics into an rmarkdown document. The ODG-Graphics file is not included directly into the rmd-document, but it is converted into a format such as pdf or png, that can then be used as graphics in an rmd-document.


## Introduction
One basic requirements for document authors is the ability to include graphics into a document. The technical details of how that is done depends on the document authoring system that is used. 

### WYSIWYG
Most such systems have their own graphics functionality included. Alternatively it is also possible to prepare the graphics in a specialized program, and then include the graphics via drag-and-drop into the document or some menu-based functionality for graphics inclusion can be used. 


### LaTeX
According to lshort there are some packages to produce graphics directly in the LaTeX-source document. Graphics can also be produced outside of LaTeX and can then be included into the document using the function `\includegraphics`. 


### HTML
In HTML documents, graphics are produced in a separate program and are included using the `<img src>`-tag.


## Methods
Depending on the format of output produced from an rmd-document, graphics can be included in one of two ways according to LaTeX or according to HTML. The R-package `knitr` provides the function `include_graphics()` which can be used for both output formats. That is why, we will be using this functionality.  

This package `rmddochelper` has already an existing method of creating an odg-graphic using the function `create_odg_graphic()`. This function is called not from within a document, but outside of the document in a separate R-console (e.g. in RStudio). This function is rather complicated to use, because it offers many parameters. A first approach might very well be to simplify this function.
