## Disclaimer
This vignette describes the search for and the design for an easy to use functionality to include ODG-Graphics into an rmarkdown document. The ODG-Graphics file is not included directly into the rmd-document, but it is converted into a format such as pdf or png, that can then be used as graphics in an rmd-document.


## Introduction
One basic requirements for document authors is the ability to include graphics into a document. The technical details of how that is done depends on the document authoring system that is used. 

### WYSIWYG
Most such systems have their own graphics functionality included. Alternatively it is also possible to prepare the graphics in a specialized program, and then include the graphics via drag-and-drop into the document or some menu-based functionality for graphics inclusion can be used. 


### LaTeX
According to lshort there are some packages to produce graphics directly in the LaTeX-source document. Graphics can also be produced outside of LaTeX and can then be included into the document using the function `\includegraphics`. 


### HTML
In HTML documents, graphics are produced in a separate program and are included using the `<img src>`-tag.


## Methods
Depending on the format of output produced from an rmd-document, graphics can be included in one of two ways according to LaTeX or according to HTML. The R-package `knitr` provides the function `include_graphics()` which can be used for both output formats. That is why, we will be using this functionality.  

This package `rmddochelper` has already an existing method of creating an odg-graphic using the function `create_odg_graphic()`. This function is called not from within a document, but outside of the document in a separate R-console (e.g. in RStudio). This function is rather complicated to use, because it offers many parameters. A first approach might very well be to simplify this function. This is postponed to a later point in time, in favor of building a function for a smoother workflow which is described below.


## Workflow
An author is writing a document and decides to include a diagram, a figure or a drawing into that document. What is important at this point is that the graphical object (be it a diagram, a figure, a drawing or something else) that should be included is to be produced or generated by a software program outside of the ordinary text-editing program. 


### Creation
One possible way of creating such a graphical object would be to run an R-function which might be called `rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic` inside an R-code-chunk in that text as shown below and this would open the external program such that we could create our graphical object.

```{r my_first_graphic, eval=FALSE}
#rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "my_first_graphic.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(ps_path = "my_first_graphic.png")
```

When executing this function inside the Rmd-source-file, an odg-file is created in the directory where this rmd-file is located. The above shown function is supposed to work like the `devtools::use_*` class of functions. An important pre-requisite of the shown function is that we have a tool available to create a graphical object in an odg-format. One example of such a tool is `LibreOffice draw`. 


### Inclusion
In most cases the original version of the graphical object is in a format that cannot directly be included in a document like an rmarkdown-document. Hence it needs to be converted into a usable format such as `pdf` or `png`. In the case of `odg` graphics produced with `LibreOffice` draw, we can use the functionality of `LibreOffice` to do the format conversion. After the format conversion, we need to insert the R-code chunk that includes the graphical object into the rmardown-source document. This chunk looks as follows

```{r my_frist_graphic_knitr, eval=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "my_first_graphic.png")
```

In the end this chunk will consist of several parts. One part is the statement that calls the `knitr::include_graphics()` function. This function call gets the converted graphic file as argument. Furthermore, it is required that the chunk label has the same name as the included graphic file without extension. This requirement comes from the automated format conversion. 



### Format conversion
The format conversion is best done in a knitr-hook function. A good reference to knitr-hook function is given on https://yihui.name/knitr/hooks/. 



## Old Legacy Stuff below

The question is how we can decide the location of this rmd-document. One possibility is to use the `rprojroot` package. The function `thisfile()` returns the absolute path to this rmd-document as shown below.

```{r}
this_rmd_rprojroot <- rprojroot::thisfile()
cat("This file is: ", this_rmd, "\n")
```

But the solution with `rprojroot` works only when the rmd-document is transformed using `knitr` because the determination of the path to the current rmd-source document is based on functionality in `knitr`. Hence when trying to run a chunk inside this document interactively as in a notebook, the solution using `rprojroot` does not work.



Depending on the parent directory of this rmd-document, we want to place the created odg-graphic in a different place. In case this rmd-source document is placed in a separate subdirectory called `rmd`, we put all odg-graphics under `../odg`. Otherwise, the odg-graphic is just put in a subdirectory called `odg`. 

```{r}
par_dir <- basename(dirname(this_rmd))
cat("Parent directory: ", par_dir, "\n")
# determine odg_dir
get_odg_dir4this_rmd <- function(ps_this_rmd){
  # determine parent directory of ps_this_file
  s_parent_dir <- dirname(ps_this_rmd)
  s_base_parent_dir <- basename(s_parent_dir)
  s_odg_parent_dir <- s_parent_dir
  if (s_base_parent_dir == "rmd") 
    s_odg_parent_dir <- dirname(s_parent_dir)
  return(file.path(s_odg_parent_dir, "odg"))
  
}
# output
cat("Current odg_dir: ", get_odg_dir4this_rmd(ps_this_rmd = this_rmd))
cat("Test odg_dir: ", get_odg_dir4this_rmd(ps_this_rmd = file.path(dirname(this_rmd), "rmd", basename(this_rmd))))
```

At this point we are ready to place the created odg-graphic in an automatically determined subdirectory. This subdirectory is determined using the function `get_odg_dir4this_rmd()`. The call to the cration function would then be

```{r my_second_odg, eval=FALSE}
s_odg_dir <- get_odg_dir4this_rmd(ps_this_rmd = this_rmd)
s_odg_file <- file.path(s_odg_dir, "my_second_odg.odg")
rmddochelper::use_odg_graphic(ps_odg_file = s_odg_file)
```
